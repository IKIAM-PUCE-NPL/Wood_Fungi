# Introduction

in progress...

# Before to start

in progress....

# eRah package workflow

eRah package installation and library loading.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# eRah package installation
#install.packages('erah')
# eRah library call
library(erah)

```

Delete unwanted files of data directory and create a directory with the desired files. 

```{r echo=TRUE}

# Delete all file that are not in folders
unlink('Data/Data_to_eRah/*')
# Data folder path
createdt('Data/Data_to_eRah/')

```

Creating a data.frame with chromatograms information.

```{r echo=TRUE}

# Loading (*.CDF) chromatograms
instrumental <- read.csv('Data/Metadata_to_eRah/Metadata_inst.csv')
# Loading metadata of the chromatograms
phenotype <- read.csv('Data/Metadata_to_eRah/Metadata_pheno.csv')
# Merge of metadata information with chromatograms
raw_data <- newExp(instrumental = instrumental,
                   phenotype = phenotype,
                   info = 'Wood fungi')

```

## Compound Deconvolution

Parameters for spectra deconvolution are specified, defining specific criteria on peak width and minimum peak height, noise threshold, and excluding certain ranges of m/z values from processing to improve the accuracy and relevance of chemical analysis.

```{r echo=TRUE}

dec_par <- setDecPar(min.peak.width = 0.7,
                     min.peak.height = 500,
                     noise.threshold = 75,
                     avoid.processing.mz = c(59:64,73:75,147:149),
                     analysis.time = c(3.3,56))

```

To carry out a process in parallel we use the "future" package, which allows us to execute tasks in parallel, improving efficiency and processing speed simultaneously.

```{r echo=TRUE}

plan(future::multisession,
     workers = 14)

```

The deconvolution algorithm is executed using the parameters specified above, the results obtained will be saved in 'MetaboSet' S4 object.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

dec_data <- deconvolveComp(raw_data,
                           dec_par)

```

## Alignment

Alignment of GC-MS deconvolved compounds with defined parameters.

```{r echo=TRUE}

# Alignment parameters
alig_par <- setAlPar(min.spectra.cor = 0.90,
                     max.time.dist = 4,
                     mz.range = 50:550)
# Alignment
peak_alig <- alignComp(dec_data,
                       alParameters = alig_par)

```

## Missing Compound Recovery

This algorithm allow compound recovery. If a compound appears in at least of four samples than the minimum samples value, then, this compound is searched in the rest of the samples where its concentration has not been registered.


```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

peak_find <- recMissComp(peak_alig,
                         min.samples = 2)

```

# Blank subtraction

Exporting feature list to blank subtraction.

```{r echo=TRUE}

# Extracting alignment feature list
feat_list <- alignList(peak_find,
                       by.area = FALSE)
# Exporting alignment feature list
#write.csv(feat_list,
#          file = "Result/eRah_Result/eRah_Feature_List.csv")

```

"notame" package installation for blank subtraction.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

# Notame package installation
#if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
#  install.packages("devtools")
#}
#devtools::install_github("antonvsdata/notame", ref = "v0.3.1")

# Notame library call
library(notame)

# Dependency packages installation
install_dependencies

```

Loading the last exported eRah feature list (in Excel format according "notame" instruction).

```{r echo=TRUE}

data <- read_from_excel(file = "Data/eRah_Feature_List.xlsx", sheet = 2, 
                        corner_row = 4, corner_column = "G", 
                        split_by = c("Column", "Ion mode"))

```

"notame" MetaboSet construction with the Loading feature list.

```{r echo=TRUE}

modes <- construct_metabosets(exprs = data$exprs, 
                              pheno_data = data$pheno_data, 
                              feature_data = data$feature_data,
                              group_col = "Group")

```

Flag contaminant to avoid in subsequent analysis.

```{r echo=TRUE}

# Data extraction
mode <- modes$SHRTX5SilMS_EI
# Change 0 value to NA
mode <- mark_nas(mode, value = 0)
# Removal of contaminants
no_blank <- flag_contaminants(mode,
                              blank_col = "Group",
                              blank_label = "Blank",
                              flag_thresh = 0.39,
                              flag_label = "Contaminant")
# Removal blank group from dataset
no_blank <- no_blank[, no_blank$Group != "Blank"]

# Exporting data to clean identified features
#write_to_excel(no_blank,
#               "Result/eRah_Result/eRah_Feature_List_no_blank.xlsx")

```
